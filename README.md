這個插件會讓整個界面所有的元素包含圖片縮略圖等（除了視頻）都統一爲一種顏色，這樣看起來的界面風格就會統一，在黑暗環境下的閲讀更加舒適不刺眼，但是副作用是占用性能，不過看起來酷也是很難取捨的。

This plugin will unify the entire interface—including all elements like image thumbnails (except videos)—into a single color. This creates a consistent visual style, making reading more comfortable and less straining in dark environments. However, the downside is that it consumes additional system resources. Yet, the sleek appearance it offers is often a trade-off worth considering.

視頻也可以强制添加單色濾鏡，但是我在style.css文件内注釋了，因爲嚴重影響了系統資源，加上意義不大，所以沒有啓用，有需要的朋友可以因應耍酷的情況開啓。

至於圖片瀏覽模式也被單色化，其實我有斟酌過是否避開，但是既然添加了濾鏡就不必增加複雜程度了，大量的css被注釋，還需要進一步梳理以及精簡，因爲我是使用deep seek編寫的，還需要時間讓這個插件更好。

Videos can also be forcibly overlaid with a monochrome filter, but I have commented it out in the style.css file because it heavily consumes system resources and doesn’t add much practical value, so it remains disabled. Friends who need it for a cooler visual style can enable it as desired.

As for the image viewing mode being monochromatized as well—I did consider avoiding it, but since the filter is already applied, there's no need to overcomplicate things. Large portions of CSS are currently commented out and still require further organization and simplification. Because this plugin was written with the help of DeepSeek, it will take more time to refine and make it better.

The .theme file is a high-contrast style file designed for the Windows 10 and 11 systems. It works best when paired with complementary elements for optimal use.
